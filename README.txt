This project is the result of a discussion between myself and a friend
over ten years ago.  I found the code recently while cleaning.

I've cleaned up the code some, it may be interesting to some.

I should also add the ability to customize the battle participants...

To build, you should be able to just type 'make' (on Linux or Cygwin).

To run the regression, 'make test'
